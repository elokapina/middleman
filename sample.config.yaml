# Default values are shown

# The string to prefix messages with to talk to the bot in group chats
command_prefix: "!middleman"

# Options for connecting to the bot's Matrix account
matrix:
  # The Matrix User ID of the bot account
  user_id: "@bot:example.com"
  # Matrix account password (optional if access token used)
  user_password: ""
  # Matrix account access token (optional if password used)
  # Please note, if you use an access token, you must ensure the token and device pair exists
  # in the Matrix server database. For example for Synapse (replacing device id and user token):
  #    insert into access_tokens (id, user_id, device_id, token) values (
  #       (select max(id)+1 from access_tokens), '@bot:example.com', '<device id>', '<user_token>'
  #    );

  # The URL of the homeserver to connect to
  homeserver_url: https://example.com
  # The device ID that is **non pre-existing** device
  # If this device ID already exists, messages will be dropped silently in encrypted rooms
  device_id: ABCDEFGHIJ
  # What to name the logged in device
  device_name: middleman-bot

    Hello! I'm Middleman, a bot. I will relay your message forward to the maintainers of this
    bot. When they reply, you will see the message here. Ps. Sorry, images are not currently
    supported, text only please!
  # Operate in "mentions only" for rooms that look like non-direct messages,
  # This is based on the nio "is_named" logic, ie a room is a named room if it has
  # 1) an alias or 2) a name. Direct messages often don't have names, they are
  # generated dynamically based on the participants.
  # When set to true, "mention_only_rooms" has no effect.
  mention_only_always_for_named: false
  # List of rooms to only relay messages from when explicitly mentioned
  # Any rooms here (alias or ID) will have messages relayed to the management
  # room only if the bot is mentioned in the message. This allows joining the bot
  # to rooms with a large amount of messages for support needs, for example.
  # When "mention_only_always_for_named" is set to true, this has no effect.

  # Relay media replies from management room to original sender directly
  # When set to true, management room will send back media replies to original sender
  # When set to false, media replies will not be sent back to original sender because
  # we can't normally prefix `!reply` in the message body
  # (Optional, default: false)

# Logging setup
logging:
  # Logging level
  # Allowed levels are 'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR', 'DEBUG' where DEBUG is most verbose
